# What we will be doing and description of motivation:  

Topic 11: Design and implement a TCP/IP communication with a symmetric encryption that 	transmits messages among multiple (more than two) hosts. 

Allows us to enhance our understanding of sockets and inter process communication between a 	client and server architecture.

# Executing Existing Code

To begin using the chat room, a server.py must be running first. By default, the server is set to run on localhost (0.0.0.0) on port 1234. Once a server has been started, many client.py instances may be started. By default, the clients are set to connect directly to the localhost server.py at 0.0.0.0:1234. This will be expanded later allowing for a client to select which server (if multiple are available) to connect to.
